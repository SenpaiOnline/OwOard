## Description
OwOard is a simple stupid grid-oriented soundboard application.

Once upon a time, I was looking for a grid-oriented soundboard, but I've failed. So you have this one, enjoy!

## Installation
WIP

## Usage
WIP, but, in a nutshell, you have to use a virtual audio cable (eg. [VB-CABLE](https://www.vb-audio.com/Cable/index.htm)) 
and, optionally, an audio mixer (eg. [Voicemeeter](https://www.vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/index.htm)) in addition to this
application.

## Visuals
My GLaDOS soundboard, February 2020.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Logo
- [ ] Setup CI
- [ ] Tests
- [ ] Visual animations
- [ ] Ability to post a keyboard event to be able to hold on a button in push-to-talk applications

Questionable:
- [ ] Migrate to TornadoFX JDK10+ branch
- [ ] Ability to consume a keyboard event
- [ ] Multiple soundboards in one application
